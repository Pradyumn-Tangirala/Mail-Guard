Phishing Email Detection System
Project Overview
This project is designed to detect phishing emails using machine learning techniques. Phishing attacks are a common method used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information. The system analyzes the textual content of emails (specifically, the subject line and body) and classifies them as either phishing or legitimate. By implementing this tool, the project aims to improve email security for users and reduce the likelihood of falling victim to phishing scams.

Key Features
Accurate Phishing Detection: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify phishing patterns in email text with high accuracy.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a clean and intuitive interface that allows users to easily input and analyze email content.

Real-Time Feedback: Delivers immediate classification results, along with insights into the prediction process.

Technologies Used
Languages and Frameworks
Python: Used for backend logic, machine learning model development, and API handling.

JavaScript: Supports frontend interactivity.

HTML/CSS: Used to structure and style the frontend interface.

FastAPI: A modern web framework used to build the REST API for backend services.

Libraries and Tools
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for building and training classification models.

TfidfVectorizer: Converts raw email text into numerical features suitable for model training and prediction.

Uvicorn: An ASGI server used to serve the FastAPI backend.

Nginx (optional): Used for production deployment to handle static file serving and reverse proxying.

Git/GitHub: Version control and collaborative development platform.

Project Scope
The system focuses exclusively on textual analysisâ€”including the subject and body of an email.

It does not analyze:

Attachments

Embedded images

Clickable links or URLs

This limited scope is intentional, aiming to provide a lightweight and focused solution for initial phishing detection based solely on message content.

Expected Outcomes
A fully functional email analysis system capable of classifying emails as phishing or legitimate.

A scalable and easy-to-integrate solution that can potentially be used in larger email platforms or cybersecurity tools.

Enhanced awareness and proactive defense mechanisms for users against email-based threats.
